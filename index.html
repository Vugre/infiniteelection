        <h2>What's this all about?</h2>
        
        <p>
            This project is about a survey system that is a collection of unlimited number of questions and 2-way answers for each (We may add more answer options in the future). The users pick one of the answers and then get to see the results of the others (ex:%70 on answer A, %30 on answer B).
        </p>

        <p>
            All of the questions, results, feedbacks ext... will be stored in a massive database and observed by the us the developers. We want to ask many crazy and creatie questions and be able to show what people thinnk, give statistics according to age, sex, nationality... And even show friend's answers to the question the user just anwered.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We also want to give the user, the option to submit their own questions.Not just that but vote for good questions to become online, add different multiple-choice anwers to spesific questions, and give feetback to the questions already available.  We want to actually finish and release the project online by the end of the semester..
        </p>

        <h3>Project’s Main Functions</h3>
        <h3>1) Collect user choices for the “formerly created questions":</h3>
        <p>Collecting this data and linking the users by their choices.This allows us to let people see which of their friends have chosen which answer. Another usage may be linking the people of the same interests. </p>
        
        
        <p>Here are a few examples:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li>Vote numbers</li>
            <li>Vote perstengates</li>
            <li>A list of friends who made similar decisions with you.</li>
            <li>More Statistics according to Age/Sex/Nationality.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2) Asking people for more questions:</h3>
        <p>Users will be able to upload their own questions, their own answers or answerduos. They will also have the ability to vote these as positive or negative. To encourage people for doing these, we thought of an in-app currency system where you are able to gain “tokens” for your efforts, which doesn’t have a purpose right now.
            </p>

       <p> Project has a GUI plan to look with more appeal. Also facebook implementation is under construction. This is because facebook allows us to have an instant massive user-base instead of advertising for the signing up.
        </p>
        
        <h3>3) Getting feedback and suggestions:</h3>
        <p>Users should be able to vote for the newly submitted questions they liked. They should also be able to suggest more anwers for an spesific question, and to give feedback about the question they were asked. All this should be implemented in a , very easy and simple way.
        </p>
